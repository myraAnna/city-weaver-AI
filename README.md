## üéØ Problem Statement

**Design a solution using GenAI for Digital Creativity & Insights**

- **Last-minute stress** - Need a solid plan quickly but overwhelmed by options

## üí° Solution

Travel-Jer is a conversational AI travel planner that acts like your Malaysian friend. Get paired with authentic local personas‚Äîlike Auntie Lim from Penang or Asha from Sabah‚Äîwho guide you through Malaysia with personal stories, insider tips, and cultural insights.

It's not just directions. It's experiencing Malaysia through someone who calls it home.

## ‚ú® Key Features
