I was just looking through some of our local foodie groups on Facebook and Reddit, you know, to see what's the latest buzz. Someone asked for the 'ultimate' wanton mee, and I swear, I saw at least 15 different Ipoh folks all shouting the same name: Xibei Good. The consensus is clear, lah!\nTo us, it is practically THE BEST wanton mee in town. The noodles are springy, the dark sauce is just the right amount of savoury and sweet... haiya, so good.\n",
